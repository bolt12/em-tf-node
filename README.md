# em-tf-node

Expectation-Maximization algorithm implementation in Javascript(NodeJS) using TensorflowJS

# Introduction

This class is an implementation of the EM Algorithimic that's present in the 'Machine Learning An Algorithimic Perspective' by Stephen Marsland in Javascript (Node JS) using the Tensorflow library.

The book has its own implementation using Python and Numpy you can check it out here: https://seat.massey.ac.nz/personal/s.r.marsland/MLBook.html

In this moment the algorithm only supports two gaussians. I'm still figuring out how to implement this algorithm for a more general multivariate normal.

## WIC

This implementation is still on development, I appreciate any kind of contribution to this repository
